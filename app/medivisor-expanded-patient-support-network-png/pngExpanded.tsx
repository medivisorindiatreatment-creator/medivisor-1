                                    Over the last one year, Medivisor India Treatment has walked alongside more than a hundred families from Papua New Guinea and helped them access life-changing treatment in India. Behind every number is a human story — a mother, a father, a child — and a family that was once afraid, confused, and searching for hope.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As awareness grows, we are receiving an overwhelming number of calls and messages. This clearly shows that many more people in Papua New Guinea are suffering quietly and do not know where to turn for help.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    While digital platforms have helped us reach many families, we also recognize a difficult reality: many of the countrymen are not online or are not comfortable using technology. As a result, they continue to struggle in silence — not because the treatment doesn't exist anywhere in the world, but because they cannot reach it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To address this gap, we have launched the Medivisor Expanded Patient Support Network (PNG). This network is designed to reach villages, churches, and local communities and ensure that no one is left behind simply because they cannot connect digitally.

                                    Since Medivisor alone cannot go deep and wide, we now invite compassionate, service-minded individuals and organizations across Papua New Guinea to join hands with us as:
